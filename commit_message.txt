feat: Automate smoke test setup and execution

This commit automates the smoke test setup and execution for the NL Job-Hunt Autopilot project.

Key changes include:
- Modified `scripts/smoke.sh` to ensure the `jobs_live` table is consistently in the expected state (one row) before running the smoke test. This involves truncating the table and inserting a single row.
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to remove the `db-migrate` service, as its functionality is now handled directly within the `smoke.sh` script for improved reliability and control over database state during testing.
